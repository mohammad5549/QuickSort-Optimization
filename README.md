# QuickSort-Optimization
MIPS Assembly efficient program for QuickSort and Compiler Generated code for C++ program modified and optimized for faster runtime.

This project compares two assembly implementations of a simple swap function, which swaps the values of two integer variables by using their pointers. The first implementation is compiler-generated, and the second is an optimized version designed to minimize redundancies and enhance performance.

This project also compares two assembly implementations of the partition function, a core routine commonly used in quicksort algorithms. The first implementation is compiler-generated, while the second is optimized for performance and clarity by reducing stack operations and maximizing register usage.

Lastly, this project compares two assembly implementations of the quickSort function, an essential recursive algorithm for sorting arrays. The first implementation is compiler-generated, while the second is optimized to improve efficiency by leveraging registers and reducing stack usage.
